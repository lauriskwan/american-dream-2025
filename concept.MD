# ReadyTable - Project Overview

## 1. The Problem: The Two Waits of Peak-Hour Dining

During peak hours, dining at a popular restaurant involves two significant and frustrating waits:

1. **The wait for a table** - spent in a long, unpredictable physical queue
2. **The wait for food** - time spent idly at the table waiting for your order to be taken, prepared, and served

This turns a quick meal into a lengthy ordeal.

### Impact on Diners
- Poor experience defined by uncertainty and wasted time
- Diminished enjoyment of the meal itself

### Impact on Restaurants
- Inefficient table turnover
- Operational bottlenecks in kitchen and front-of-house
- Potential lost revenue

## 2. The Solution: Synchronized Arrival & Service

ReadyTable is an intelligent platform that eliminates both waits by perfectly synchronizing the diner's arrival with the kitchen's food preparation. It creates a true "just-in-time" dining experience where your table and your meal are ready the moment you walk in.

### How It Works

**Eliminates the Wait for a Table:**
- Virtual queue tells diners exactly when to head to the restaurant
- No more physical lines

**Eliminates the Wait for Food:**
- Diners pre-order their meals
- Kitchen begins preparation at the precise moment needed
- Food is ready upon arrival

**Result:** Seamless transition from walking in the door to enjoying your meal.
